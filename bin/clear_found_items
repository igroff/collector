Usage:
    clear_found_items (--user_id=<user_id> --searcher_id=<searcher_id> --start_time=<start_time>)

Options:
    --user_id=<user_id>          user_id of the user searching
    --searcher_id=<searcher_id>  id of the searcher, can be the same as user_id
    --start_time=<start_time>    The time the search started. There can be only
        a single search for a given user_id and searcher_id at a time, but the
        start time actually provides the 'instance id' of the search for a given
        user and searcher. Since items found are specific to a search we use 
        this information to make that relationship.

This method simply clears the found item information that is created by find_items.
