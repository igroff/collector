Usage:
    find_items (--user_id=<user_id> --searcher_id=<searcher_id> --start_time=<start_time> --location=<location> --duration=<duration>)

Options:
    --user_id=<user_id>          user_id of the user searching
    --searcher_id=<searcher_id>  id of the searcher, can be the same as user_id
    --location=<location>        The location of the search this can be a named
        location or a set of lat,long coordinates
    --start_time=<start_time>    The time the search started. There can be only
        a single search for a given user_id and searcher_id at a time, but the
        start time actually provides the 'instance id' of the search for a given
        user and searcher. Since items found are specific to a search we use 
        this information to make that relationship.
    --duration=<duration>  Duration of the search in seconds.

Determine what items are found for the provided search.  This uses information
about the user_id ansd searcher_id to determine what items are found, as those 
entities may change over the duration of the search (which could run for a very
long time) this method should be called at search start.

This function will store the information about the items found in the 
'collector_found_items' table, for later retrieval.  The found items should be
cleared using clear_found_items when the search completes or is cancelled.
