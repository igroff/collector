### Items

Items are created by combining materials in certain way, the ways that materials
combine to form items are defined by recipes. Materials can come in various
qualities that can affect the quality of the final product.

### Unique Items

Some items are not created, they are found whole and they are truly unique. 
These items are unique within the context of the game, only a single instance
exists and thus, only one user can have one at any given time. These items, 
can be traded, given away, dropped, etc. just like all other items in the game.
